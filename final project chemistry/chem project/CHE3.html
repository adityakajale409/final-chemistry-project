    <h1 class="heading">OBJECTIVE OF ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <P>As human influence on the natural environment increases, setting priorities for environmental protection becomes
        ever more important and urgent. Landmark policies established more than two decades ago in the US, address
        largely local, reversible, and direct threats to human health. These do not suffice in managing impacts of the
        human enterprise today, impacts that are transforming the environment at a pace, at a geographic scale, and with
        problems of irreversibility that are totally unprecedented.</P>
    <br>
    <p>When considering environmental protection in the US, it is helpful to maintain a global perspective. The US is a
        major contributor to, and recipient of global impacts, both directly through its own economic activities and
        indirectly through its intimate biophysical, socioeconomic, and political links to other regions of the world.
        Worldwide, humanity has heavily transformed ∼40–50% of the ice-free land surface; coopted ∼50% of accessible,
        renewable fresh water; fully exploited or overexploited ∼65% of marine fisheries; increased the carbon dioxide
        concentration in the atmosphere by ∼30%; increased the rate of fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by more than
        100% over natural terrestrial sources; and driven ∼25% of bird species to extinction (Vitousek et al., 1997).
        The rapid increase projected globally in demand for food, fresh water, energy, and other resources over the next
        few decades implies greatly intensifying human impacts (Pinstrup-Andersen, 1994, Crosson and Anderson, 1995,
        Postel et al., 1996, UNFAO, 1996, Daily et al., 1998, Gleick, 1998, Hoffert et al., 1998).</p>
    <br>
    <p>How do these profound ecosystem changes influence human well-being, and how should they be addressed by policy?
        Which merits the most attention? What levels and types of changes are acceptable? How can appropriate standards
        be developed and evaluated? And what institutions and policies will be effective in conferring the desired
        protection?</p>
    <br>
    <p>To address these questions, we must recognize that the Nation's — and the world's — ecosystems are capital
        assets; if properly managed, they yield a flow of vital services. Ecosystem services include the production of
        goods — such as seafood, timber, and precursors to many industrial and pharmaceutical products — an important
        and familiar part of the economy. They also include basic life-support processes (such as pollination, water
        purification, and climate regulation), life-fulfilling conditions (such as serenity, beauty, and cultural
        inspiration), and preservation of options (such as conserving genetic and species diversity for future use)
        (Daily, 1997a).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Proper accounting would value the flow of ecosystem services, while costing out the depreciation of the
        underlying asset, just as for physical capital, for example. Unfortunately, relative to other forms of capital,
        ecosystem capital is poorly understood, scarcely monitored, and — in many important cases — undergoing rapid
        degradation and depletion. Often the importance of ecosystem services is widely appreciated only upon their
        loss. As a result, the depreciation of ecosystem capital is typically undervalued, to the extent that it is
        considered at all.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>This unfortunate situation is not difficult to understand. Until fairly recently, ecosystem capital was available
        in sufficient abundance that most ecosystem services could be treated as ‘free.’ Moreover, economic activity was
        comparatively limited, and had minimal impact on ecological systems. There was, accordingly, little interaction
        between the fields of ecology and economics. However, in recent decades the situation has changed dramatically,
        as indicated above.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The situation today demands a much improved capability for characterizing ecosystem services, in ecological and
        economic terms. This would make possible the weighing of the full social costs and benefits of alternative
        policies and courses of action. Ideally, it would reveal what is really at stake to allow for better
        decision-making, before ecosystem changes become so entrained as to be very costly and difficult (or impossible)
        to reverse. The benefits of developing and using this capability are manifest in the efforts by a growing number
        of municipalities in the US to secure natural water purification services in their watersheds (The Trust for
        Public Land, 1997). Such efforts are often justified solely on the basis of the avoided costs of building and
        maintaining physical treatment plants; they may confer many other unquanitified benefits as well, however, in
        the form of flood/erosion control, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, scenic beauty, and so on.

    <h2>Environment protection act</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The act came into force in 1986.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It authorizes the central government to improve and protect environmental quality, reduce and control
                pollution from the sources, and restrict or prevent the setting and operation of any industrial facility
                on environmental grounds.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The following are the objectives of the Environment Protection Act:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>It was enacted with the prime motto of providing protection and improvement of the environment and the things associated with it.</p></li>
        <li><p>To take strict actions against those who harm the environment.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>To safeguard the better environment and environmental conditions.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>To apply the decisions made at the United Nations Conference on Human Environment, which was held in the year 1972 in Stockholm.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>To enforce laws regarding the protection of the environment in the regions, which are not included in the prevailing laws.
        </p></li>
