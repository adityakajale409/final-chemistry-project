            <h1>Protection of Ecosystem</h1>
        </center>
        <h2>Importance of Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>All of the Earth's plants and animals rely on ecosystems to provide food and habitat. Ecosystems must
            maintain a delicate balance in order to stay vital. For example, a deer living in the meadow ecosystem needs
            water to drink, vegetation to eat and shrubs and bracken to sleep and hide in. If the deer population
            increases too much for their current ecosystem to provide these things, the extra deer will have to search
            for food and shelter elsewhere, encroaching on the habitats and ecosystems of other species.</p>
        <h2>Human Influence</h2>
        <p>Humans also rely on ecosystems to provide food and natural resources. For example, the wood used to create
            lumber for building and pulp for paper comes from the Earth's many forest ecosystems. When natural resources
            are harvested out of an ecosystem, it can disrupt the delicate balance if not done in a responsible way.
            According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment sponsored by the United Nations, 60% of the ecosystems on
            Earth are being used up faster than they can replenish themselves.</p>
        <h2>Protecting the Earth's Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>The ecosystems of the Earth can be protected through responsible use. Heavily cultivated lands planted in
            single crops can be replaced with diverse cropping systems that help maintain soil productivity and prevent
            erosion. As homeowners, humans can plant native species that provide food and shelter to animals. These
            native species tend to grow with less supplemental water and little need for fertilization, which both
            conserves and protects our water sources. As consumers, humans can buy sustainably grown goods, use fewer
            disposable products and purchase products with minimal packaging or recyclable packaging. Each act of
            conservation in our homes, yards and workplaces reduces the stress on our ecosystems and helps maintain the
            necessary balance to maintain them.</p>
        <h2>How Do Plants & Animals Depend on Each Other?</h2>
        <p>The global ecosystem depends on both plants and animals to survive -- and as part of that ecosystem, plants
            and animals need each other. Although their symbiotic relationship is sometimes subtle, at other times their
            impact on one another is striking.</p>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>Plants and animals benefit each other as members of food chains and ecosystems. For instance, flowering
            plants rely on bees and hummingbirds to pollinate them, while animals eat plants and sometimes make homes in
            them. When animals die and decompose, they enrich the soil with nitrates that stimulate plant growth.</p>
        <h3>Symbiosis</h3>
        <p>Many relationships between plants and animals are mutually beneficial. For instance, flowers need
            hummingbirds to pollinate them, just as hummingbirds need the flowers' nectar to refuel.</p>

            alt="ecosystem">
        <h3>Global significance</h3>
        <p>Plants provide a global benefit to animals by releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. Although pollination and
            food chains affect only a few local plants and animals, they frequently overlap to form larger food webs
            that contain hundreds or even thousands of wildlife species. This global significance means that when one
            plant or animal goes extinct, many others suffer as a result.</p>

        <h2>Ways to Maintain Ecological Balance</h2>
        <p><em>The Earth's organisms interact with their environment in a delicately balanced cycle. Plants use energy
                from the sun, and they become food for other creatures. The cycle continues as plant and animal life
                forms die and get consumed by microorganisms. Bu this cycle of life is in jeopardy from humanity's
                overuse of natural resources and damage to the ecosystem from pollution. Read on to learn more about
                maintaining balanced ecosystems.</em></p>

            alt=" ecological balance">
        <h2>Manage Natural Resources Carefully</h2>
        <p><em>The expansion of civilization inflicts a growing burden on the ecosystem. Minerals, fossil fuels and
                other natural resources disappear at an alarming rate. Overfishing and habitat destruction create a loss
                of biodiversity that will have long-term negative consequences on the ecosystem. The overuse or
                destruction of their habitats threatens species with extinction. You can see this in marine ecosystems
                where the loss of just a few species can threaten an entire ecosystem. A concerted effort to use natural
                resources in a sustainable manner will help to protect and maintain ecological balance.</em></p>
        <img src="https://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/600x600p/cpi.studiod.com/www_ehow_com/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/100/158/125171211_XS.jpg"
            alt="natural resourses">
        <h2>Control the Population</h2>
        <p><em>In nature, predators prevent species from over populating. Unfortunately, humans don't have any natural
                predators to control the population. It's necessary to take action at the individual level and
                government level to control population. This problem is important despite emotional, cultural or
                religious sensitivity to the issue. Just as too many fish in your aquarium fouls the water, too many
                humans on the planet can upset the ecological balance. Between 1927 and 1987, the Earth's population
                increased to 5 billion. By the year 1999 total population reached 6 billion, and it's estimated that
                nearly 9 billion people will be living on the Earth in the year 2050. Controlling the birth rate through
                contraception and family planning will reduce the strain on the ecosystem by reducing the rate at which
                people consume natural resources.</em></p>
        <img src="https://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/600x600p/cpi.studiod.com/www_ehow_com/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/108/105/158682734_XS.jpg"
            alt="control overpopulation">
        <h2>Protect the Water</h2>
        <p><em>Contamination from sewage, and pollution from manufacturing and agricultural runoff threatens the balance
                of marine ecosystems. Sewer and agricultural runoff can cause a cascade of damaging effects on the
                ecosystem. Taking steps to reduce or eliminate pollution from nonpoint sources such as streets and farms
                will help to maintain the ecological balance. Sewage and run-off of agricultural fertilizer can cause
                the rapid growth of algae in lakes and streams. The growth of algae blocks sunlight and depletes the
                oxygen in the water. This causes a reduction in the amount of natural plant life in the marine
                ecosystem. The animals that feed on the plants die, which leads to the death of animals that prey on
                them. The decaying algae promote the growth of anaerobic organisms, which release compounds into the
                water that are toxic to marine animals.</em></p>

            alt="water pollution">
        <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
        <p><em>Protecting the ecological balance is an issue that everybody can become involved in. You have the power
                to have a positive effect, no matter how small, in maintaining the delicate balance of the Earth's
                ecosystem. Recycle to help prevent the over-harvesting of natural resources. Conserve energy by choosing
                more energy efficient appliances and automobiles. If everybody uses less energy, pollution decreases and
                less coal gets used to power the nation and the world. Encourage family and friends to be ecologically
                aware in the ways that they live day-to-day. Just as many hands make light work, many individuals
                working together can help by protecting and maintaining ecological balance.</em></p>

            alt="A sequential arrangement of  some things">

        <h2>How Humans Disrupt the Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>Humans affect ecosystems both directly and indirectly, and these effects can range from minimal to
            catastrophic. Through fossil fuel combustion, humans have disturbed the makeup of the breathable air,
            changed the quality of the soil and water and have altered the types and distributions of plants and animals
            around the globe. These effects can act singularly, though they more frequently act in concert with one
            another within ecosystems.</p>
        <img src="https://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/560x350p/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/151/146/87765841.jpg?type=webp"
            alt="pollution">
        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity's reliance on the combustion of fossil fuels has led to changes in
            atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, the frequency and intensity of atmospheric ozone and smog, and
            the production of other potent greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane. Further, increases in
            agricultural production and the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers have depleted essential soil nutrients,
            increased the transport of nitrogen and phosphorus to streams and rivers and led to the degradation of water
            quality.</p>
        <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>As the human population increased, the amount of land needed to house and feed everyone also has increased.
            To accommodate the increasing population, habitat critical for other plants and animals has decreased,
            leading to reduced populations of various birds, fish, mammals and plants. Prior to human encroachment, some
            keystone species, such as the gray wolf, were critical in maintaining populations deer populations, one of
            their primary food sources. Deer populations have increased throughout the nation due to lack of predation
            by gray wolves, becoming pests in many communities.</p>
        <h2>Interactive Effects</h2>
        <p>As in all ecosystems, many, if not all, components are connected in one way or another. Therefore,
            alterations to one component, such as soil quality, can affect other components, such as water quality and
            biodiversity. For example, excess fertilizer application in the agricultural Midwestern United States has
            led to degraded water quality throughout the Mississippi River watershed, including the hypoxic, or
            oxygen-degraded, zone of the Gulf of Mexico, which influences local and regional fisheries.</p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p><em>While not all impacts on ecosystems are reversible, there are several ways to minimize and reverse
                human-induced adverse effects. Green technologies that reduce reliance on fossil fuels, decrease waste
                and have low carbon footprints can make measurable differences on the quality of multiple ecosystems.
                For example, utilizing public transportation and car-pooling can reduce gaseous carbon emissions,
                alternative energy sources produce fewer atmospheric contaminants and reducing the reliance on
                large-scale agriculture can help reduce soil and water pollution by minimizing excessive use of
                synthetic fertilizers.</em></p>
        <div class="conservewater">
            <h2>What Happens When We Do Not Conserve Water?</h2>
            <p>It may seem easiest just to leave the water running while you brush your teeth, but wasting all of that
                water has serious consequences for the environment and human health. Why is water conservation an issue?
                Although water appears to be abundant, it is a limited resource and making it drinkable uses a lot of
                energy. Only a small proportion of Earth's water is fresh water, and less than 1% of that is accessible
                for human use. It is important to conserve water now because, if the human race does not conserve water,
                there may soon be disruptions in the supply of food and clean water available for human consumption.</p>
            <h3>Current Water Shortages</h3>
            <p>Many areas in the western United States already experience water shortages. At the beginning of 2014,
                California faced its worst drought in 500 years, according to B. Lynn Ingram, a professor at the
                University of California, Berkeley. The State Water Project, which supplements the local water supply
                for several California towns, is completely out of water.</p>
            <br>
            <p>California's drought conditions are not unique dry conditions are causing reservoirs to dry up, wildfires
                to ignite and livestock to starve all over the world. Water shortages are commonplace in many of the
                other southwestern states of the United States, like Arizona and New Mexico. If humans do not start
                saving water now, a growing number of people will struggle to find fresh drinking water. The situation
                will only be made worse in the near future by global climate change.</p>
            <h3>Impact on food supply</h3>
            <p>Dwindling water supplies mean less available water for agricultural irrigation. Almost 70 percent of the
                water used by people is used to water crops and livestock for food production. The global population is
                increasing, which will increase the demand for food and thus the demand for water. However, global water
                supplies are decreasing due to pollution and contamination.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Conserving water will help maintain the water supply necessary for food production. Crops cannot grow
                without adequate moisture, so if the water supply diminishes, food prices will rise and more people will
                experience food insecurity. Conserving water at home and at workplaces will make more available for the
                essential task of producing food crops.</p>
            <h2>Ecological Consequences of Water Shortages</h2>
            <p>Water scarcity threatens ecosystems worldwide. More than half of the Earth's wetlands have dried up or
                been destroyed due to demands for fresh water and the changing climate. Wetlands are home to a diverse
                array of animal and plant life. They often act as nurseries for birds and fish, so their disappearance
                has had a significant effect on several species and food webs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Other ecosystems, and the species they support, have been negatively affected by drought. People rely on
                nature as a food source, as well as a source of income from hunting, tourism and other recreational
                activities. Water conservation helps preserve various ecosystems and the plants and animals (including
                humans) that rely on them.</p>
            <h2>Water Conservation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Nearly a billion people worldwide lack a reliable source of clean water, and there is a big discrepancy
                between water consumption in developed and developing countries. Conserving water ensures that everyone
                has the opportunity to quench their thirst, regardless of which country they call home.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What does water conservation mean? You can help by being mindful of your water consumption and limiting
                it whenever possible. Take short showers and turn the water off while brushing your teeth. Run the
                dishwasher only when it is full and only do full loads of laundry. Instead of pouring water down the
                drain, use it to water plants. When it's time to replace toilets, faucets and washers, purchase
                water-conserving devices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="deforestation">
            <h2>Why Is Deforestation a Serious Global Environmental Problem?</h2>
            <p>Legal and illegal deforestation is a huge issue worldwide. It is vital that everyone is able to explain
                why deforestation is a problem both locally and globally for the simple reason that it affects everyone.
                Humans and other animals rely on trees to produce the oxygen that we breathe. Without oxygen, we would
                not be able to live.</p>
            <h2>Deforestation Definition</h2>
            <p>The definition of deforestation is the removal of trees and plants by humans. Deforestation can be done
                using machines, like slashing away clearings with a machete or logging with chainsaws, through planned
                or accidental fires, or by leaving cattle to heavily graze in a forested area. While we often think of
                deforestation as the large-scale, illegal destruction of rainforests, deforestation also includes legal
                practices such as the removal of pine trees for wood in a purposefully planted pine forest. Problems
                from deforestation arise on both large mountain-type scales and small backyard-size scales.</p>
            <h3>Why Do People Practice Deforestation?</h3>
            <p>Humans have been practicing deforestation to varying degrees for centuries all around the world. People
                may remove forests to create space and to harvest the resources needed to build temples, pyramids,
                villages, cities and roads. Civilizations throughout history have cleared land for farms, to grow crops
                or mine precious resources.</p>
            <h2>Global Environmental Impacts of Deforestation</h2>
            <p>Deforestation causes many issues on both a local and global scale. The first issue, as mentioned earlier,
                is that plants are essential for animal life as they convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. The global
                effects of deforestation don't end there; large forest systems, such as the Amazon rainforest, play a
                significant role in global water cycles. Deforestation of these critical areas affects the availability
                of freshwater supplies worldwide.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Deforestation also removes habitat for wild animals. Many animals need large areas of forest for healthy
                population dynamics. It's not just making forests smaller that is the problem; dividing forests in half
                with a road, for example, can threaten species. Deforestation is one of the leading causes of endangered
                species and extinction around the globe.</p>
            <h2>Localized Deforestation Issues</h2>
            <p>Plants are also essential for stabilizing the soil. Deforestation can cause runoff of sediment from the
                land into rivers, lakes and the ocean. The extra sediment in the waterways can smother animals and block
                their access to light. If pesticides and other dangerous chemicals were used on the land, these
                chemicals then leach into waterways and poison the organisms that live there..</p>
            <br>
            <p>Alternatively, sediment runoff can boost the nutrients in waterways. Boosting the nutrients in an
                environment may sound like a good thing, but this isn't always the case. Added nutrients can cause some
                organisms, such as toxic algae to thrive, creating an imbalance in the ecosystem. Algal blooms can both
                poison animals that eat them and smother waterways.</p>
            <h2>How Can We Help Prevent Further Damage From Deforestation?</h2>
            <p>Some animals and plants cannot live in regenerating forests. Therefore, the only way to prevent further
                damage from deforestation is to stop doing it while simultaneously focusing on restoring already damaged
                areas. Healthy forest ecosystems can take potentially hundreds of years to recover with slow-growing
                trees.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the main drivers causing deforestation is the demand for consumer products. If people only demand
                products that have been harvested using sustainable methods, then more companies will be required to
                adopt better practices to remain competitive in the market. For example, when building new homes, people
                can opt for sustainable building materials. Even by selecting environmentally considerate products
                during everyday shopping, people can reduce the demand for destructive deforestation.</p>
            <h2>Helping Reduce Small-Scale Effects of Deforestation in Your Backyard</h2>
            <p>On a small scale, people need to consider the effects that removing trees from their backyard or
                neighborhood will have on the ecosystem they live. Do any native birds live in the tree? Is it a food
                source for local wildlife? Is the tree near any waterways and removing it will cause sediment to enter
                the waterways?</p>
            <br>
            <p>If it is essential that people remove a tree from their backyard, measures can be taken to reduce the
                negative impact this will have. Planting new plants as replacements will help stabilize soil; adding
                compost or weed-free mulch and sweeping up any excess dirt will help prevent sediments from washing
                away.</p>

            <h2>How Are Greenhouse Gases Bad for the Earth?</h2>
            <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural function of Earth’s atmosphere, the happy result of which is a livable
                world. Gases in the atmosphere, especially water vapor, insulate the Earth, preventing the sun’s heat
                from escaping. The Earth stays warm and life thrives. But human activity, especially the use of fossil
                fuels, has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. More heat is absorbed, increasing
                the greenhouse effect and bringing negative consequences to Earth’s systems and life.</p>
            <h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3>
            <p>Greenhouse gases can occur through natural processes, such as volcanic eruption, or through human
                activity. Those generated through human behavior are problematic because they alter Earth’s natural
                systems. Problematic GHGs include methane, nitrous oxide and especially carbon dioxide. By burning
                fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and petroleum, humans have contributed large amounts of CO2 to
                the atmosphere. The United States produces most of its energy from these fossil fuels. Other GHGs
                include water vapor, F-gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and tropospheric
                ozone . </p>
            <h3>Global Warming</h3>
            <p>Human contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere has risen sharply since the EPA reports. The CO2
                collects in the atmosphere, trapping more heat. The result is global warming. The phrase means that
                Earth’s average temperature is increasing. Since 1880, it has risen 1 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit, reports
                the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The temperature increase is melting ice stored at the
                Earth’s poles, which creates a change in sea level. It also creates climate change. </p>
            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change means that the average weather on Earth is different than it used to be. Consequences of a
                changed climate can include freak weather, increased flooding, hotter heat waves, stronger hurricanes
                and more droughts. The changes in weather create still more results. For instance, more droughts create
                the dry conditions that fuel massive wildfires. Meanwhile, climate change affects Earth’s biodiversity,
                and biodiversity is needed for healthy ecosystems. Species are going extinct at a breakneck rate -- up
                to 1,000 times faster than normal, says the International Union for Conservation of Nature. </p>
            <h3>Ozone and F-Gases</h3>
            <p>Human energy production releases chemicals such as nitrogen oxide that react with other chemicals when
                sunlight is present, creating ozone, another greenhouse gas. Ozone is harmful to ecosystems as well. It
                damages crops and creates respiratory problems in human beings. Chlorofluorocarbons and
                hydrochlorofluorocarbons are chemicals used in refrigerants -- for example in automobile air
                conditioners. CFCs destroy the natural atmospheric ozone layer, so industry began using HCFCs instead.
                HCFC, though, is a greenhouse gas. All the F-gases last a long time, so humans will be living with their
                effects on the climate for tens if not hundreds of years, the EPA warns. </p>

            <h2>How Can We Actively Restore the Environment?</h2>
            <p>Human activity has many detrimental effects on the environment. The use of chemicals can damage fragile
                ecosystems, the garbage produced by humans pollutes land and water and energy production results in
                harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. Reversing these effects and restoring the
                environment is a complicated process comprised of various efforts that differ depending on location and
                circumstances. Active restoration of the environment includes small community efforts, such as planting
                trees in the backyard, and large-scale efforts, such as restoring the Louisiana bayou ecosystem after
                Hurricane Katrina.</p>

            <h3>Watershed Restoration</h3>
            <p>The United States government and the state of Florida have invested more than $10 billion in a 35-year
                plan to restore the Everglades, a 1.5-million acre wetlands preserve that is home to many vulnerable
                plant and animal species. Steps taken to restore the Everglades include managing the delivery of fresh
                water to the area in order to reverse the degradation caused by human activities and removing exotic
                invasive species.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig sank to the ocean floor in 2010, a massive oil spill
                damaged the environment in the Gulf of Mexico. Water was contaminated, wildlife was killed and restoring
                that environment involved much more than just cleaning up the oil. It took a lot of manpower to restore
                the area’s river banks and replant wetlands.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It does not take a disaster to damage a riparian environment. On a smaller scale, efforts to restore this
                type of environment include planting vegetation on stream banks to prevent erosion, filtering pollutants
                before they reach the water and providing cover for fish and other wildlife.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Several groups work to restore watershed habitat, so local volunteer opportunities are easy to find. For
                example, in the Pacific Northwest, Adopt a Stream Foundation works to restore trout and salmon habitat
                by adding character - in the form of fallen trees and riparian vegetation - to spawning streams damaged
                by logging practices.</p>
            <h3>Forest Restoration</h3>
            <p>Logging is one of the most significant threats to forest ecosystems. Aggressive replanting efforts help
                slowly restore trees to the forest, but other actions are necessary to return the forest to its natural
                state. These efforts include leaving dead trees to rot and enrich the soil system and encouraging the
                growth of several plant species. Recreationists can help restore forests by staying on established
                trails and packing out garbage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Forests are also threatened by the development of commercial and agricultural space. In developing
                tropical countries, forests are cut down to make room for farms, but groups like the Union of Concerned
                Scientists are working to intensify crop production on existing farmland to reduce the need for forest
                restoration efforts.</p>
            <h3>Grassland Restoration</h3>
            <p>Grasslands are rapidly disappearing throughout the United States, but several groups are working to
                restore this ecosystem. In New York, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is restoring grassland
                habitat in an effort to restore populations of the birds that nest in this ecosystem. They mow down
                woody vegetation, so that it no longer competes for space and resources with native grass species. Then,
                the area is reseeded with a variety of native grasses.</p>
            <h2>Reduce the Need for Restoration</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to contribute to the restoration of natural environments is to help reduce the need
                for restoration in the first place. Recycling materials such as paper and plastic will reduce the
                harvest of the raw materials used to create these products, such as trees and petroleum. It is possible
                to save more petroleum and reduce emissions that are harmful to the environment by walking, riding a
                bike or carpooling whenever possible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Conserving energy by turning off lights and turning down the heat will also help reduce harmful
                emissions, such as the sulfur emitted when coal and oil are burned. Sulfur emissions contribute to the
                formation of acid rain, which further degrades the environment, according to the United States
                Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
